Simpy is a minimal clone of the popular automation utility 
[Simba](https://github.com/MerlijnWajer/Simba), writen in Python and targeting 
Python as a scripting language. 

## Installing

First clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/BenLand100/Simpy
```

And then install with pip:

```
pip install --user -e Simpy
```

This will create an editable installation that will link to the cloned git repo. 
This means the Simpy code installed on your system will automatically be updated
if the repo is updated or edited.

Reinstallation may still be necessary if there are new dependencies.

## Usage

Simpy is a minimal IDE that runs Python scripts. After installing, you can run
the program `Simpy` to launch the GUI. It will also open a file as an argument.
Press `Run` on the GUI to execute the open file.

You can probably figure out the how to use it without further instructions.
